    "# Text-to-Speech Automation with Background Music Overlay\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project automates the process of converting text data into speech using Google Cloud's Text-to-Speech API and overlays the generated speech with background music using the `pydub` library. The final output is a collection of MP3 files enriched with background audio, suitable for applications like podcasts, audiobooks, or multimedia presentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the scripts, ensure you have the following installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python 3.x**: The programming language used for scripting.\n",
    "- **Google Cloud Account**: To access the Text-to-Speech API.\n",
    "- **FFmpeg**: A multimedia framework required by `pydub` for audio processing.\n",
    "- **Python Libraries**:\n",
    "  - `pandas`: For handling Excel files.\n",
    "  - `pydub`: For audio manipulation.\n",
    "  - `google-cloud-texttospeech`: For interfacing with Google's Text-to-Speech API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Just select one Google Cloud Setup, gTTS, ElevenLabs\n",
    "\n",
    "a.1 **Create a Google Cloud Project**:\n",
    "   - Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).\n",
    "   - Click on **\"Select a Project\"** and then **\"New Project\"**.\n",
    "   - Provide a name and create the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "a.2 **Create an account in ElevenLabs**:\n",
    "   - Get an API to your account.\n",
    "\n",
    "a.3 **gTTS works without account it is FREE**:\n",
    "\n",
    "b. **Enable the Text-to-Speech API**:\n",
    "   - Within your project, go to **\"APIs & Services\" > \"Library\"**.\n",
    "   - Search for **\"Text-to-Speech API\"** and click **\"Enable\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. **Set Up Authentication**:\n",
    "   - Go to **\"APIs & Services\" > \"Credentials\"**.\n",
    "   - Click **\"Create Credentials\"** and select **\"Service Account\"**.\n",
    "   - Fill in the required details and proceed.\n",
    "   - After creating the service account, navigate to it and create a **JSON key**.\n",
    "   - Download the JSON key file and save it securely; you'll need its path later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Install FFmpeg\n",
    "\n",
    "**For Windows**:\n",
    "- Download the FFmpeg executable from the [official website](https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds/releases).\n",
    "- select and download ffmpeg-master-latest-win64-gpl file\n",
    "- Extract the contents and add the `bin` directory to your system's PATH environment variable.\n"
